                    <p class="p-text1">Snowboarding is a recreational and competitive activity 
                    that involves descending a snow-covered surface while standing on a 
                    snowboard that is almost always attached to a rider's feet. It features 
                    in the Winter Olympic Games and Winter Paralympic Games. Snowboarding was 
                    developed in the United States, inspired by skateboarding, sledding, 
                    surfing, and skiing. It became popular around the world, and was 
                    introduced as a Winter Olympic Sport at Nagano in 1998 and featured 
                    in the Winter Paralympics at Sochi in 2014. As of 2015, its popularity 
                    (as measured by equipment sales) in the United States peaked in 2007 
                    and has been in a decline since.</p>

                <p class="p-text2">The first snowboards were developed in 1965 when 
                    Sherman Poppen, an engineer in Muskegon, Michigan, invented a 
                    toy for his daughters by fastening two skis together and attaching 
                    a rope to one end so he would have some control as they stood on 
                    the board and glided downhill. Dubbed the "snurfer" (combining 
                    snow and surfer) by his wife Nancy, the toy proved so popular 
                    among his daughters' friends that Poppen licensed the idea to a 
                    manufacturer, Brunswick Corporation, that sold about a million 
                    snurfers over the next decade. And, in 1966 alone, over half a 
                    million snurfers were sold.</p>

                    <p>Though snowboarding seems intimidating on the surface, 
                        you’d probably be shocked to learn how safe it actually is. 
                        Did you know that less than 1% of snowboarders suffer an 
                        injury? It seems unlikely, given the fast and furious nature 
                        of the sport, but it’s entirely true.</p>

                    <p>The Guinness Book of World Records recorded that the highest 
                        speed ever reached on a snowboard was 201.907kph (125mph). 
                        The record was set by Australian snowboarder Darren Powell 
                        at the French resort of Les Arcs in 1999 and remains unbroken
                         today. How rapid is that!</p>
