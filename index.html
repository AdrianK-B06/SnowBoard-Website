            <p class="p-text1">Snowboarding is a recreational and competitive activity 
                that involves descending a snow-covered surface while standing on a snowboard 
                that is almost always attached to a rider's feet. It features in the 
                Winter Olympic Games and Winter Paralympic Games. Snowboarding was 
                developed in the United States, inspired by skateboarding, sledding, 
                surfing, and skiing. It became popular around the world, and was 
                introduced as a Winter Olympic Sport at Nagano in 1998 and featured 
                in the Winter Paralympics at Sochi in 2014. As of 2015, its popularity 
                (as measured by equipment sales) in the United States peaked in 2007 
                and has been in a decline since.</p>
